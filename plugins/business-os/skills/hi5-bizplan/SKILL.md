# Hi5 Bizplan — Business Plan Generator

## Purpose
Generate a comprehensive, personalized business plan based on the member's Master Profile. Ask for the business numbers and goals not captured in setup. Tailor everything to their behavioral style, industry, and market.

## Core Rules
- Read Master Profile first — never ask for info already captured in setup
- One question at a time
- Reference their name and specific details throughout
- Tailor tone and delivery to their behavioral style from /hi5-self
- High D → lead with numbers and action steps
- High I → lead with vision and excitement
- High S → lead with stability and steady growth
- High C → lead with data and detailed breakdown

## OPENING

Read from Master Profile:
- PROFILE.name
- PROFILE.industry
- PROFILE.re_role (if real estate)
- PROFILE.primary_market
- PROFILE.behavioral_style
- PROFILE.success_vision
- PROFILE.biggest_blocker

Open with:

## GENERATE THE PLAN

After all questions:

> "Perfect — I have everything I need. Give me a moment to put this together."

Generate a comprehensive business plan with these sections:

### 1. Agent Snapshot
Summary of who they are, their market, role, experience, and brand. Written in second person, specific to their data.

### 2. Where You Stand
Honest assessment of last year's numbers. Conversion funnel analysis with diagnosis — lead problem, conversion problem, or market problem. No fluff, just clarity.

### 3. Your 12 Month Target
GCI goal, transaction goal, transactions needed per month, average commission needed per deal. Make the math visible and simple.

### 4. Your Lead Engine
Based on top source and desired source — specific recommendations for how to generate leads consistently. Tailored to their platforms, budget, and style.

### 5. Your Marketing Plan
Based on marketing goals selected — specific content strategy, platforms to prioritize, posting cadence, and quick wins. Tied to their YouTube status and social platforms.

### 6. Your Conversion System
Based on CRM and conversion funnel data — specific recommendations for improving lead to agreement and agreement to close rates.

### 7. Your 90 Day Roadmap
Month 1 / Month 2 / Month 3 — specific actions, not generic advice. What to do first, what to build next, what to optimize last.

### 8. Your Biggest Opportunity
One clear insight about where their biggest untapped opportunity is based on all their data.

### 9. What Success Looks Like
Reference their success vision from /hi5-self. Connect the numbers to what they actually want.

Tailor tone throughout to behavioral style:
- High D: direct, punchy, action-oriented, no fluff
- High I: vision-forward, energetic, story-driven
- High S: steady, reassuring, relationship-focused
- High C: data-heavy, detailed, logical progression

## OUTPUT AND STORAGE

After generating:

> "Your business plan is ready, [name]. Here is what I am doing with it:
>
> ✅ Saving to your Notion workspace under Business OS → Business Plan
> ✅ This becomes a living document — run /hi5-bizplan anytime to update it as your numbers change
>
> Would you also like a downloadable version you can save, print, or share?"

If yes → format as a clean markdown document and output in full for them to copy, or save as a Google Doc if Drive is connected.

## NEXT STEP

> "Now that your business plan is set, let's lock in your quarterly goals. Run /hi5-goals and I will break your annual target into 90 day sprints so you always know exactly what you should be working on.
>
> Ready?"
