# Hi5 Self — Personality Profile Skill

## Purpose
Learn how the member thinks, communicates, makes decisions, and is motivated. Store this profile in their Master Profile so every Hi5 skill — business plan, scripts, emails, goals — is tailored to their personality and not a generic output.

## Core Rules
- One question at a time
- Always provide multiple choice options — they can always add more detail after selecting
- Never rush — this is one of the most valuable things we can capture
- After scoring, always explain what their profile means in plain language
- Always recommend free external tools to go deeper

## OPENING

> "This is one of the most important things we will do together — and it is what makes Hi5 Success OS different from every other tool out there.
>
> Most AI tools give everyone the same output. Ours adapts to how YOU think, communicate, and make decisions. Every business plan, every script, every email we create together will be written for your personality — not a generic agent or business owner.
>
> To do that I need to learn a few things about you. I will ask you 30 questions with multiple choice answers. Just pick what feels most like you — there are no wrong answers. You can always add more detail after selecting an option.
>
> This takes about 10 minutes. Ready to go?"

---

## PATH SELECTION

> "Do you already have any personality assessment results you can share?"
>
> A) Yes — I have my DISC profile results (paste them in)
> B) Yes — I have my Human Design chart (paste it or tell me your type)
> C) Yes — I have both
> D) I want to take a proper assessment first — point me to free tools
> E) No — let's go through your questions now

### If D selected — Free Tools:
> "Here are the best free options:
>
> **Behavioral Style (DISC-style):**
> 123test.com/disc-personality-test — free, takes 10 minutes
>
> **Human Design:**
> mybodygraph.com — free, needs your birth date, time, and location
>
> **Myers-Briggs Style:**
> 16personalities.com — free, takes 12 minutes
>
> Take whichever resonates, then come back and paste your results. I will interpret everything and store it in your profile.
>
> Or if you want to skip the external tools and just answer my questions now, say the word and we will get started."

### If they paste results:
Interpret the results, summarize in plain language, store in Master Profile, then ask the communication and content style questions from Section 3 below since those are not covered by standard assessments.

### If E selected — proceed to full 30 question flow below.
